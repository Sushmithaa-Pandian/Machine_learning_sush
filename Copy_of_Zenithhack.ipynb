We relate our mathematical\\napproach to the hippocampal memory indexing theory. We describe the first\\ndetailed mathematical models for the complete processing pipeline from sensory\\ninput and its semantic decoding, i.e., perception, to the formation of episodic\\nand semantic memories and their declarative semantic decodings. Our main\\nhypothesis is that perception includes an active semantic decoding process,\\nwhich relies on latent representations of entities and predicates, and that\\nepisodic and semantic memories depend on the same decoding process. We\\ncontribute to the debate between the leading memory consolidation theories,\\ni.e., the standard consolidation theory (SCT) and the multiple trace theory\\n(MTT). The latter is closely related to the complementary learning systems\\n(CLS) framework. In particular, we show explicitly how episodic memory can\\nteach the neocortex to form a semantic memory, which is a core issue in MTT and\\nCLS.\\n',\n",

From these expressions, we show that applying the K-means\\nalgorithm in the compressed domain enables to recover the clusters of the\\noriginal domain. Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the accuracy of the\\nobtained approximated error probabilities, and show that the coding rate needed\\nto perform K-means clustering in the compressed domain is lower than the rate\\nneeded to reconstruct all the measurements.\\n',\n",

The\\ndifficulties of solving the Helmholtz equa- tion are two fold. Firstly, in the\\ncase of large scale problems we cannot calculate the inverse of the Helmholtz\\noperator directly. Hence, iterative algorithms should be implemented. Secondly,\\nthe Helmholtz operator is non-unitary and non-diagonalizable which in turn\\ndeteriorates the performances of the iterative algorithms (especially for high\\nwavenumbers). To overcome this issue, we need to im- plement proper\\npreconditioners for a Krylov subspace method to solve the problem efficiently.\\nIn this paper we incorporated shifted-Laplace operators to precondition the\\nsystem of equations and then generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method used\\nto solve the problem iteratively. The numerical results show the performance of\\nthe preconditioning operator in improving the convergence rate of the GMRES\\nalgorithm for data modelling case. In the companion paper we discussed the\\napplication of preconditioned data modelling algorithm in the context of\\nfrequency domain full waveform inversion. However, the analysis of the degree\\nof suitability of the preconditioners in the solution of Helmholtz equation is\\nan ongoing field of study.\\n',\n",

The\\ndefinition of polarization angle in BK14 maps has gone through self-calibration\\nin which the overall angle is adjusted to minimize the observed $TB$ and $EB$\\npower spectra. After this procedure, the $QU$ maps lose sensitivity to a\\nuniform polarization rotation but are still sensitive to anisotropies of\\npolarization rotation. This analysis places constraints on the anisotropies of\\npolarization rotation, which could be generated by CMB photons interacting with\\naxion-like pseudoscalar fields or Faraday rotation induced by primordial\\nmagnetic fields. The sensitivity of BK14 maps ($\\\\sim 3\\\\mu$K-arcmin) makes it\\npossible to reconstruct anisotropies of polarization rotation angle and measure\\ntheir angular power spectrum much more precisely than previous attempts. Our\\ndata are found to be consistent with no polarization rotation anisotropies,\\nimproving the upper bound on the amplitude of the rotation angle spectrum by\\nroughly an order of magnitude compared to the previous best constraints. Our\\nresults lead to an order of magnitude better constraint on the coupling\\nconstant of the Chern-Simons electromagnetic term $f_a \\\\geq 1.7\\\\times\\n10^2\\\\times (H_I/2\\\\pi)$ ($2\\\\sigma$) than the constraint derived from uniform\\nrotation, where $H_I$ is the inflationary Hubble scale.

For robots to interact with\\nhumans autonomously they need active decision making that takes human partners\\ninto account.

While some systems exhibit\\nstripes of charge and spin, with a locked periodicity, others host charge\\ndensity waves (CDWs) without any obviously related spin order. Here we use\\nresonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) to follow the evolution of charge\\ncorrelations in the canonical stripe ordered cuprate\\nLa$_{1.875}$Ba$_{0.125}$CuO$_{4}$ (LBCO~$1/8$) across its ordering transition.\\nWe find that high-temperature charge correlations are unlocked from the\\nwavevector of the spin correlations, signaling analogies to CDW phases in\\nvarious other cuprates. This indicates that stripe order at low temperatures is\\nstabilized by the coupling of otherwise independent charge and spin density\\nwaves, with important implications for the relation between charge and spin\\ncorrelations in the cuprates.\\n',\n",

We quantify this\\ndifficulty with a coefficient that measures the distance between the observed\\nfinal results of sports leagues and idealized perfectly balanced competitions\\nin terms of skill. This indicates the relative presence of luck and skill. We\\ncollected and analyzed all games from 198 sports leagues comprising 1503\\nseasons from 84 countries of 4 different sports: basketball, soccer, volleyball\\nand handball. We measured the competitiveness by countries and sports. We also\\nidentify in each season which teams, if removed from its league, result in a\\ncompletely random tournament. Surprisingly, not many of them are needed. As\\nanother contribution of this paper, we propose a probabilistic graphical model\\nto learn about the teams' skills and to decompose the relative weights of luck\\nand skill in each game. We break down the skill component into factors\\nassociated with the teams' characteristics. The model also allows to estimate\\nas 0.36 the probability that an underdog team wins in the NBA league, with a\\nhome advantage adding 0.09 to this probability. As shown in the first part of\\nthe paper, luck is substantially present even in the most competitive\\nchampionships, which partially explains why sophisticated and complex\\nfeature-based models hardly beat simple models in the task of forecasting\\nsports' outcomes.\\n\",\n",

Our framework for\\nface texture transfer (FaceTex) augments the prior work of MRF-CNN with a novel\\nfacial semantic regularization that incorporates a face prior regularization\\nsmoothly suppressing the changes around facial meso-structures (e.g eyes, nose\\nand mouth) and a facial structure loss function which implicitly preserves the\\nfacial structure so that face texture can be transferred without changing the\\noriginal identity. We demonstrate results on face images and compare our\\napproach with recent state-of-the-art methods.

This is based on the assumption that one can find\\noverlapping cliques spanning the network. That is, for each sensor, one can\\nidentify geometric neighbors for which all inter-sensor ranges are known. Such\\ncliques can be efficiently localized using multidimensional scaling. However,\\nsince each clique is localized in some local coordinate system, we are required\\nto register them in a global coordinate system. In other words, our approach is\\nbased on transforming the localization problem into a problem of registration.\\nIn this context, the main contributions are as follows. First, we describe an\\nefficient method for partitioning the network into overlapping cliques. Second,\\nwe study the problem of registering the localized cliques, and formulate a\\nnecessary rigidity condition for uniquely recovering the global sensor\\ncoordinates. In particular, we present a method for efficiently testing\\nrigidity, and a proposal for augmenting the partitioned network to enforce\\nrigidity. A recently proposed semidefinite relaxation of global registration is\\nused for registering the cliques. We present simulation results on random and\\nstructured sensor networks to demonstrate that the proposed method compares\\nfavourably with state-of-the-art methods in terms of run-time, accuracy, and\\nscalability.\\n',\n",

Applications to 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko  We simulate the stresses induced by temperature changes in a putative hard\\nlayer near the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko with a\\nthermo-viscoelastic model. Such a layer could be formed by the recondensation\\nor sintering of water ice (and dust grains), as suggested by laboratory\\nexperiments and computer simulations, and would explain the high compressive\\nstrength encountered by experiments on board the Philae lander. Changes in\\ntemperature from seasonal insolation variation penetrate into the comet's\\nsurface to depths controlled by the thermal inertia, causing the material to\\nexpand and contract. Modelling this with a Maxwellian viscoelastic response on\\na spherical nucleus, we show that a hard, icy layer with similar properties to\\nMartian permafrost will experience high stresses: up to tens of MPa, which\\nexceed its material strength (a few MPa), down to depths of centimetres to a\\nmetre. The stress distribution with latitude is confirmed qualitatively when\\ntaking into account the comet's complex shape but neglecting thermal inertia.\\nStress is found to be comparable to the material strength everywhere for\\nsufficient thermal inertia ($\\\\gtrsim50$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$) and ice\\ncontent ($\\\\gtrsim 45\\\\%$ at the equator). In this case, stresses penetrate to a\\ntypical depth of $\\\\sim0.25$ m, consistent with the detection of metre-scale\\nthermal contraction crack polygons all over the comet.

The first\\nmethod is a newly developed algorithm, named YATTALENS, which looks for\\narc-like features around massive galaxies and then estimates the likelihood of\\nan object being a lens by performing a lens model fit. The second method,\\nCHITAH, is a modeling-based algorithm originally developed to look for lensed\\nquasars.

We\\nfind 15 definite lenses, 36 highly probable lenses and 282 possible lenses.\\nAmong the three methods, YATTALENS, which was developed specifically for this\\nproblem, performs best in terms of both completeness and purity. Nevertheless\\nfive highly probable lenses were missed by YATTALENS but found by the other two\\nmethods, indicating that the three methods are highly complementary.

An important accelerator were first\\nindications for a modulating signal rate in the DAMA/NaI experiment reported in\\n1997. Today the presence of an annual modulation, which matches in period and\\nphase the expectation for dark matter, is supported at > 9$\\\\sigma$ confidence.\\nThe underlying nature of dark matter, however, is still considered an open and\\nfundamental question of particle physics. No other direct dark matter search\\ncould confirm the DAMA claim up to now; moreover, numerous null-results are in\\nclear contradiction under so-called standard assumptions for the dark matter\\nhalo and the interaction mechanism of dark with ordinary matter. As both bear a\\ndependence on the target material, resolving this controversial situation will\\nconvincingly only be possible with an experiment using sodium iodide (NaI) as\\ntarget. COSINUS aims to even go a step further by combining NaI with a novel\\ndetection approach. COSINUS aims to operate NaI as a cryogenic calorimeter\\nreading scintillation light and phonon/heat signal. Two distinct advantages\\narise from this approach, a substantially lower energy threshold for nuclear\\nrecoils and particle identification on an event-by-event basis. These key\\nbenefits will allow COSINUS to clarify a possible nuclear recoil origin of the\\nDAMA signal with comparatively little exposure of O(100kg days) and, thereby,\\nanswer a long-standing question of particle physics. Today COSINUS is in R&D\\nphase; in this contribution we show results from the 2nd prototype, albeit the\\nfirst one of the final foreseen detector design. The key finding of this\\nmeasurement is that pure, undoped NaI is a truly excellent scintillator at low\\ntemperatures: We measure 13.1% of the total deposited energy in the NaI crystal\\nin the form of scintillation light (in the light detector).\\n',\n",

Identifying an LPV model of a\\nnonlinear system can be challenging due to the difficulty of selecting the\\nscheduling variable(s) a priori, especially if a first principles based\\nunderstanding of the system is unavailable. Converting a nonlinear model to an\\nLPV form is also non-trivial and requires systematic methods to automate the\\nprocess.\\nInspired by these challenges, a systematic LPV embedding approach starting\\nfrom multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) linear fractional representations\\nwith a nonlinear feedback block (NLFR) is proposed. This NLFR model class is\\nembedded into the LPV model class by an automated factorization of the\\n(possibly MIMO) static nonlinear block present in the model. As a result of the\\nfactorization, an LPV-LFR or an LPV state-space model with affine dependency on\\nthe scheduling is obtained. This approach facilitates the selection of the\\nscheduling variable and the connected mapping of system variables. Such a\\nconversion method enables to use nonlinear identification tools to estimate LPV\\nmodels.\\nThe potential of the proposed approach is illustrated on a 2-DOF nonlinear\\nmass-spring-damper example.\\n',\n",

We propose a new method to measure\\ntask similarities with cross-task transfer performance matrix for the deep\\nlearning scenario. Although this matrix provides us critical information\\nregarding similarity between tasks, its asymmetric property and unreliable\\nperformance scores can affect conventional clustering methods adversely.\\nAdditionally, the uncertain task-pairs, i.e., the ones with extremely\\nasymmetric transfer scores, may collectively mislead clustering algorithms to\\noutput an inaccurate task-partition. To overcome these limitations, we propose\\na novel task-clustering algorithm by using the matrix completion technique. The\\nproposed algorithm constructs a partially-observed similarity matrix based on\\nthe certainty of cluster membership of the task-pairs. We then use a matrix\\ncompletion algorithm to complete the similarity matrix. Our theoretical\\nanalysis shows that under mild constraints, the proposed algorithm will\\nperfectly recover the underlying \"true\" similarity matrix with a high\\nprobability. Our results show that the new task clustering method can discover\\ntask clusters for training flexible and superior neural network models in a\\nmulti-task learning setup for sentiment classification and dialog intent\\nclassification tasks.

            "       b'Caching Meets Millimeter Wave Communications for Enhanced Mobility Management in 5G Networks  One of the most promising approaches to overcome the uncertainty and dynamic\\nchannel variations of millimeter wave (mmW) communications is to deploy\\ndual-mode base stations that integrate both mmW and microwave ($\\\\mu$W)\\nfrequencies. If properly designed, such dual-mode base stations can enhance\\nmobility and handover in highly mobile wireless environments. In this paper, a\\nnovel approach for analyzing and managing mobility in joint $\\\\mu$W-mmW networks\\nis proposed. The proposed approach leverages device-level caching along with\\nthe capabilities of dual-mode base stations to minimize handover failures,\\nreduce inter-frequency measurement energy consumption, and provide seamless\\nmobility in emerging dense heterogeneous networks. First, fundamental results\\non the caching capabilities, including caching probability and cache duration\\nare derived for the proposed dual-mode network scenario. Second, the average\\nachievable rate of caching is derived for mobile users. Third, the proposed\\ncache-enabled mobility management problem is formulated as a dynamic matching\\ngame between mobile user equipments (MUEs) and small base stations (SBSs). The\\ngoal of this game is to find a distributed handover mechanism that subject to\\nthe network constraints on HOFs and limited cache sizes, allows each MUE to\\nchoose between executing an HO to a target SBS, being connected to the\\nmacrocell base station (MBS), or perform a transparent HO by using the cached\\ncontent. The formulated matching game allows capturing the dynamics of the\\nmobility management problem caused by HOFs. To solve this dynamic matching\\nproblem, a novel algorithm is proposed and its convergence to a two-sided\\ndynamically stable HO policy is proved. Numerical results corroborate the\\nanalytical derivations and show that the proposed solution will provides\\nsignificant reductions in both the HOF and energy consumption by MUEs.\\n',\n",

Quantum phenomena in\\nlarge systems emerge only when particles are strongly correlated as in\\nsuperconductors and superfluids. Cooperative interaction of correlated atoms\\nwith electromagnetic fields leads to superradiance, the enhanced quantum\\nradiation phenomenon, exhibiting novel physics such as quantum Dicke phase and\\nultranarrow linewidth for optical clocks. Recent researches to imprint atomic\\ncorrelation directly demonstrated controllable collective atom-field\\ninteractions. Here, we report cavity-mediated coherent single-atom\\nsuperradiance. Single atoms with predefined correlation traverse a high-Q\\ncavity one by one, emitting photons cooperatively with the atoms already gone\\nthrough the cavity. Such collective behavior of time-separated atoms is\\nmediated by the long-lived cavity field. As a result, a coherent field is\\ngenerated in the steady state, whose intensity varies as the square of the\\nnumber of traversing atoms during the cavity decay time, exhibiting more than\\nten-fold enhancement from noncollective cases. The correlation among single\\natoms is prepared with the aligned atomic phase achieved by nanometer-precision\\nposition control of atoms with a nanohole-array aperture.

The defenses in this area are\\nhowever still an open problem, and often lead to an arms race. We define a\\nnaive, secure classifier at test time and show that a Gaussian Process (GP) is\\nan instance of this classifier given two assumptions: one concerns the\\ndistances in the training data, the other rejection at test time. Using these\\nassumptions, we are able to show that a classifier is either secure, or\\ngeneralizes and thus learns. Our analysis also points towards another factor\\ninfluencing robustness, the curvature of the classifier. This connection is not\\nunknown for linear models, but GP offer an ideal framework to study this\\nrelationship for nonlinear classifiers. We evaluate on five security and two\\ncomputer vision datasets applying test and training time attacks and membership\\ninference. We show that we only change which attacks are needed to succeed,\\ninstead of alleviating the threat. Only for membership inference, there is a\\nsetting in which attacks are unsuccessful (<10% increase in accuracy over\\nrandom guess). Given these results, we define a classification scheme based on\\nvoting, ParGP. This allows us to decide how many points vote and how large the\\nagreement on a class has to be. This ensures a classification output only in\\ncases when there is evidence for a decision, where evidence is parametrized. We\\nevaluate this scheme and obtain promising results.\\n',\n",

We separate genuine binaries from unassociated stellar pairs\\nthrough a Bayesian formulation that includes correlated uncertainties in the\\nproper motions and parallaxes. Rather than relying on assumptions about the\\nstructure of the Galaxy, we calculate Bayesian priors and likelihoods based on\\nthe nature of Keplerian orbits and the TGAS catalog itself. We calibrate our\\nmethod using radial velocity measurements and obtain 6196 high-confidence\\ncandidate wide binaries with projected separations $s\\\\lesssim1$ pc. The\\nnormalization of this distribution suggests that at least 0.6\\\\% of TGAS stars\\nhave an associated, distant TGAS companion in a wide binary. We demonstrate\\nthat {\\\\it Gaia}'s astrometry is precise enough that it can detect projected\\norbital velocities in wide binaries with orbital periods as large as 10$^6$ yr.\\nFor pairs with $s\\\\ \\\\lesssim\\\\ 4\\\\times10^4$~AU, characterization of random\\nalignments indicate our contamination to be $\\\\approx$5\\\\%.

Simulations\\nwith GW effects cut-off above the turbopause and included in the entire\\nthermosphere have been conducted. GWs appreciably impact the mean circulation\\nand cool the thermosphere down by up to 12-18%. GWs significantly affect the\\nwinds modulated by the diurnal migrating tide, in particular in the\\nlow-latitude mesosphere and lower thermosphere and in the high-latitude\\nthermosphere. These effects depend on the mutual correlation of the diurnal\\nphases of the GW forcing and tides: GWs can either enhance or reduce the tidal\\namplitude. In the low-latitude MLT, the correlation between the direction of\\nthe deposited GW momentum and the tidal phase is positive due to propagation of\\na broad spectrum of GW harmonics through the alternating winds. In the Northern\\nHemisphere high-latitude thermosphere, GWs act against the tide due to an\\nanti-correlation of tidal wind and GW momentum, while in the Southern\\nhigh-latitudes they weakly enhance the tidal amplitude via a combination of a\\npartial correlation of phases and GW-induced changes of the circulation. The\\nvariable nature of GW effects on the thermal tide can be captured in GCMs\\nprovided that a GW parameterization (1) considers a broad spectrum of\\nharmonics, (2) properly describes their propagation, and (3) correctly accounts\\nfor the physics of wave breaking/saturation.\\n\",\n",

In the context of\\nsubgraph counting, we show how edge sampling weights can be chosen so as to\\nminimize the estimation variance of counts of specified sets of subgraphs. In\\ndistinction with many prior graph sampling schemes, GPS separates the functions\\nof edge sampling and subgraph estimation. We propose two estimation frameworks:\\n(1) Post-Stream estimation, to allow GPS to construct a reference sample of\\nedges to support retrospective graph queries, and (2) In-Stream estimation, to\\nallow GPS to obtain lower variance estimates by incrementally updating the\\nsubgraph count estimates during stream processing. Unbiasedness of subgraph\\nestimators is established through a new Martingale formulation of graph stream\\norder sampling, which shows that subgraph estimators, written as a product of\\nconstituent edge estimators are unbiased, even when computed at different\\npoints in the stream. The separation of estimation and sampling enables\\nsignificant resource savings relative to previous work. We illustrate our\\nframework with applications to triangle and wedge counting. We perform a\\nlarge-scale experimental study on real-world graphs from various domains and\\ntypes. GPS achieves high accuracy with less than 1% error for triangle and\\nwedge counting, while storing a small fraction of the graph with average update\\ntimes of a few microseconds per edge. Notably, for a large Twitter graph with\\nmore than 260M edges, GPS accurately estimates triangle counts with less than\\n1% error, while storing only 40K edges.\\n',\n",

Such regularization is interesting since (1) it can greatly speed\\nup training and inference, and (2) it can improve generalization. AIC and BIC,\\nwell-known model selection criteria, are special cases of $L_0$ regularization.\\nHowever, since the $L_0$ norm of weights is non-differentiable, we cannot\\nincorporate it directly as a regularization term in the objective function. We\\npropose a solution through the inclusion of a collection of non-negative\\nstochastic gates, which collectively determine which weights to set to zero. We\\nshow that, somewhat surprisingly, for certain distributions over the gates, the\\nexpected $L_0$ norm of the resulting gated weights is differentiable with\\nrespect to the distribution parameters. We further propose the \\\\emph{hard\\nconcrete} distribution for the gates, which is obtained by \"stretching\" a\\nbinary concrete distribution and then transforming its samples with a\\nhard-sigmoid. The parameters of the distribution over the gates can then be\\njointly optimized with the original network parameters. As a result our method\\nallows for straightforward and efficient learning of model structures with\\nstochastic gradient descent and allows for conditional computation in a\\nprincipled way. We perform various experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness\\nof the resulting approach and regularizer.\\n',\n",

However, the processes\\nregulating the gas energetics have not been well constrained by observations so\\nfar. We aim at studying the processes involved in disk photoevaporation when it\\nis driven by far-UV photons. We present a unique Herschel survey and new ALMA\\nobservations of four externally-illuminated photoevaporating disks (a.k.a.\\nproplyds). For the analysis of these data, we developed a 1D model of the\\nphotodissociation region (PDR) of a proplyd, based on the Meudon PDR code and\\ncomputed the far infrared line emission. We successfully reproduce most of the\\nobservations and derive key physical parameters, i.e. densities at the disk\\nsurface of about $10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$ and local gas temperatures of about 1000 K.\\nOur modelling suggests that all studied disks are found in a transitional\\nregime resulting from the interplay between several heating and cooling\\nprocesses that we identify. These differ from those dominating in classical\\nPDRs, i.e. grain photo-electric effect and cooling by [OI] and [CII] FIR lines.\\nThis energetic regime is associated to an equilibrium dynamical point of the\\nphotoevaporation flow: the mass-loss rate is self-regulated to set the envelope\\ncolumn density at a value that maintains the temperature at the disk surface\\naround 1000 K. From our best-fit models, we estimate mass-loss rates - of the\\norder of $10^{-7}$ $\\\\mathrm{M}_\\\\odot$/yr - that are in agreement with earlier\\nspectroscopic observation of ionised gas tracers. This holds only if we assume\\nan evaporation flow launched from the disk surface at sound speed\\n(supercritical regime). We have identified the energetic regime regulating\\nFUV-photoevaporation in proplyds. This regime could be implemented into models\\nof the dynamical evolution of protoplanetary disks.\\n',\n",

Analytical calculations revealed that the\\nmonolayer integrity of cell sheet is lost to delamination by a spontaneous\\nsymmetry breaking, inherently depending on the 3D foam geometry of cells; i.e.,\\nthe instability spontaneously appears when the cell density in the sheet plane\\nincreases and/or when the number of neighboring cells decreases, as observed in\\nvivo. The instability is also facilitated by the delaminated cell-specific\\nforce generation upon lateral surfaces, which are driven by cell-intrinsic\\ngenetic programs during cell invasion and apoptosis in physiology. In\\nprinciple, this instability emerges from the force balance on the lateral\\nboundaries among cells. Additionally, taking into account the cell-intrinsic\\nforce generation on apical and basal sides, which are also broadly observed in\\nmorphogenesis, homeostasis, and carcinogenesis, we found apically/basally\\ndirected cell delaminations and pseudostratified structures, which could\\nuniversally explain mechanical regulations of epithelial geometries in both\\nphysiology and pathophysiology.\\n',\n",

These issues\\nare particularly acute in highly non-convex settings such as those arising in\\nneural networks. Motivated by this, there has been recent interest in\\nsecond-order methods that aim to alleviate these shortcomings by capturing\\ncurvature information. In this paper, we report detailed empirical evaluations\\nof a class of Newton-type methods, namely sub-sampled variants of trust region\\n(TR) and adaptive regularization with cubics (ARC) algorithms, for non-convex\\nML problems. In doing so, we demonstrate that these methods not only can be\\ncomputationally competitive with hand-tuned SGD with momentum, obtaining\\ncomparable or better generalization performance, but also they are highly\\nrobust to hyper-parameter settings.

In\\nthis paper, we present a generic lattice construction (in three dimensions) for\\na generalized X-cube model of fracton order, where the mobility restrictions of\\nthe subdimensional particles inherit the geometry of the lattice. This helps\\nexplain a previous result that lattice curvature can produce a robust GSD, even\\non a manifold with trivial topology. We provide explicit examples to show that\\nthe (zero temperature) phase of matter is sensitive to the lattice geometry. In\\none example, the lattice geometry confines the dimension-1 particles to small\\nloops, which allows the fractons to be fully mobile charges, and the resulting\\nphase is equivalent to (3+1)-dimensional toric code. However, the phase is\\nsensitive to more than just lattice curvature; different lattices without\\ncurvature (e.g. cubic or stacked kagome lattices) also result in different\\nphases of matter, which are separated by phase transitions. Unintuitively\\nhowever, according to a previous definition of phase [Chen, Gu, Wen 2010], even\\njust a rotated or rescaled cubic lattice results in different phases of matter,\\nwhich motivates us to propose a new and coarser definition of phase for gapped\\nground states and fracton order. The new equivalence relation between ground\\nstates is given by the composition of a local unitary transformation and a\\nquasi-isometry (which can rotate and rescale the lattice); equivalently, ground\\nstates are in the same phase if they can be adiabatically connected by varying\\nboth the Hamiltonian and the positions of the degrees of freedom (via a\\nquasi-isometry). In light of the importance of geometry, we further propose\\nthat fracton orders should be regarded as a geometric order.\\n',\n",

In particular the\\ncentroids are order parameters in second-order structural phase transitions\\nsuch as, e.g., charge-density-waves or ferroelectric instabilities. According\\nto Landau's theory, the knowledge of the second derivative of the free energy\\n(i.e. the curvature) with respect to the centroids in a high-symmetry\\nconfiguration allows the identification of the phase-transition and of the\\ninstability modes. In this work we derive the exact analytic formula for the\\nsecond derivative of the free energy in the self-consistent harmonic\\napproximation for a generic atomic configuration. The analytic derivative is\\nexpressed in terms of the atomic displacements and forces in a form that can be\\nevaluated by a stochastic technique using importance sampling.

The range between the\\nvehicles was inferred from camera images using the estimated lane width\\nobtained from the lane tracking camera as the reference. Six-hundred lane\\nchange events were acquired from a large-scale naturalistic driving data set.\\nThe kinematic variables from the image-based gap analysis were filtered by the\\nweighted linear least squares in order to extrapolate them at the lane change\\ntime. In addition, the time-to-collision and required deceleration were\\ncomputed, and potential safety threshold values are provided. The resulting\\nrange and range rate distributions showed directional discrepancies, i.e., in\\nleft lane changes, large trucks are often slower than other vehicles in the\\ntarget lane, whereas they are usually faster in right lane changes. Video\\nobservations have confirmed that major motivations for changing lanes are\\ndifferent depending on the direction of move, i.e., moving to the left (faster)\\nlane occurs due to a slower vehicle ahead or a merging vehicle on the\\nright-hand side, whereas right lane changes are frequently made to return to\\nthe original lane after passing.\\n',\n",

Our methods\\nintroduce a multi-pass training method to combine the training goals of\\nhigh-quality reconstructions in areas around stop-code masking as well as in\\nhighly-detailed areas. These methods lead to lower true bitrates for a given\\nrecursion count, both pre- and post-entropy coding, even using unstructured\\nLZ77 code compression. The pre-LZ77 gains are achieved by trimming stop codes.\\nThe post-LZ77 gains are due to the highly unequal distributions of 0/1 codes\\nfrom the SCT architectures. With these code compressions, the SCT architecture\\nmaintains or exceeds the image quality at all compression rates compared to\\nJPEG and to RNN auto-encoders across the Kodak dataset. In addition, the SCT\\ncoding results in lower variance in image quality across the extent of the\\nimage, a characteristic that has been shown to be important in human ratings of\\nimage quality\\n',\n",

            "       b\"Resource Allocation for Wireless Networks: A Distributed Optimization Approach  We consider the multi-cell joint power control and scheduling problem in\\ncellular wireless networks as a weighted sum-rate maximization problem. This\\nformulation is very general and applies to a wide range of applications and QoS\\nrequirements. The problem is inherently hard due to objective's non-convexity\\nand the knapsack-like constraints. Moreover, practical system requires a\\ndistributed operation. We applied an existing algorithm proposed by Scutari et\\nal. in distributed optimization literature to our problem. The algorithm\\nperforms local optimization followed by consensus update repeatedly. However,\\nit is not fully applicable to our problem, as it requires all decision\\nvariables to be maintained at every base station (BS), which is impractical for\\nlarge-scale networks; also, it relies on the Lipschitz continuity of the\\nobjective function's gradient, which does not hold here. We exploited the\\nnature of our objective function, and proposed a localized version of the\\nalgorithm. Furthermore, we relaxed the requirements of Lipschitz continuity\\nwith the proximal approximation. Convergence to local optimal solutions was\\nproved under some conditions. Future work includes proving the above results\\nfrom a stochastic approximation perspective, and investigating non-linear\\nconsensus schemes to speed up the convergence.\\n\",\n",

            "       b'Origin of Weak Turbulence in the Outer Regions of Protoplanetary Disks  The mechanism behind angular momentum transport in protoplanetary disks, and\\nwhether this transport is turbulent in nature, is a fundamental issue in planet\\nformation studies. Recent ALMA observations have suggested that turbulent\\nvelocities in the outer regions of these disks are less than ~5-10% of the\\nsound speed, contradicting theoretical predictions of turbulence driven by the\\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI). These observations have generally been\\ninterpreted to be consistent with a large-scale laminar magnetic wind driving\\naccretion. Here, we carry out local, shearing box simulations with varying\\nionization levels and background magnetic field strengths in order to determine\\nwhich parameters produce results consistent with observations. We find that\\neven when the background magnetic field launches a strong largely laminar wind,\\nsignificant turbulence persists and is driven by localized regions of vertical\\nmagnetic field (the result of zonal flows) that are unstable to the MRI. The\\nonly conditions for which we find turbulent velocities below the observational\\nlimits are weak background magnetic fields and ionization levels well below\\nthat usually assumed in theoretical studies. We interpret these findings within\\nthe context of a preliminary model in which a large scale magnetic field,\\nconfined to the inner disk, hinders ionizing sources from reaching large radial\\ndistances, e.g., through a sufficiently dense wind. Thus, in addition to such a\\nwind, this model predicts that for disks with weakly turbulent outer regions,\\nthe outer disk will have significantly reduced ionization levels compared to\\nstandard models and will harbor only a weak vertical magnetic field.\\n',\n",

In principle, ODT can be\\nregarded as a generalization of optical projection tomography which is\\nequivalent to computerized tomography (CT). Both optical tomographic techniques\\nrequire projection-phase images of cells measured at multiple angles. However,\\nthe reconstruction of the 3D refractive index distribution post-measurement\\ndiffers for the two techniques. It is known that ODT yields better results than\\nprojection tomography, because it takes into account diffraction of the imaging\\nlight due to the refractive index structure of the sample. Here, we apply ODT\\nto biological cells in a microfluidic chip which combines optical trapping and\\nmicrofluidic flow to achieve an optofluidic single-cell rotation. In\\nparticular, we address the problem that arises when the trapped cell is not\\nrotating about an axis perpendicular to the imaging plane, but instead about an\\narbitrarily tilted axis. In this paper we show that the 3D reconstruction can\\nbe improved by taking into account such a tilted rotational axis in the\\nreconstruction process.\\n',\n",

These transitions are of high interest not only for fundamental\\nphysics and chemistry, but also may have important implications for\\ngeochemistry and geophysics of the Earth and planetary interiors. Here we have\\ncarried out a comparative study of the pressure-induced spin transition in\\ncompounds with trivalent iron, octahedrally coordinated by oxygen.\\nHigh-pressure single-crystal M\\xc3\\xb6ssbauer spectroscopy data for FeBO$_3$,\\nFe$_2$O$_3$ and Fe$_3$(Fe$_{1.766(2)}$Si$_{0.234(2)}$)(SiO$_4$)$_3$ are\\npresented together with detailed analysis of hyperfine parameter behavior. We\\nargue that $\\\\zeta$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ is an intermediate phase in the reconstructive\\nphase transition between $\\\\iota$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ and $\\\\theta$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ and\\nquestion the proposed perovskite-type structure for $\\\\zeta$-Fe$_2$O$_3$.The\\nstructural data show that the spin transition is closely related to the volume\\nof the iron octahedron. The transition starts when volumes reach 8.9-9.3\\n\\\\AA$^3$, which corresponds to pressures of 45-60 GPa, depending on the\\ncompound. Based on phenomenological arguments we conclude that the spin\\ntransition can proceed only as a first-order phase transition in\\nmagnetically-ordered compounds. An empirical rule for prediction of cooperative\\nbehavior at the spin transition is proposed. The instability of iron octahedra,\\ntogether with strong interactions between them in the vicinity of the critical\\nvolume, may trigger a phase transition in the metastable phase. We find that\\nthe isomer shift of high spin iron ions depends linearly on the octahedron\\nvolume with approximately the same coefficient, independent of the particular\\ncompounds and/or oxidation state. For eight-fold coordinated Fe$^{2+}$ we\\nobserve a significantly weaker nonlinear volume dependence.\\n',\n",

Materials\\nand Methods: We used hierarchical clustering (HC) to identify groups of meals\\nwith similar nutrition and glycemic impact for 6 individuals with T2DM who\\ncollected self-monitoring data. We evaluated clusters on: 1) correspondence to\\ngold standards generated by certified diabetes educators (CDEs) for 3\\nparticipants; 2) face validity, rated by CDEs, and 3) impact on CDEs' ability\\nto identify patterns for another 3 participants. Results: Gold standard (GS)\\nincluded 9 patterns across 3 participants. Of these, all 9 were re-discovered\\nusing HC: 4 GS patterns were consistent with patterns identified by HC (over\\n50% of meals in a cluster followed the pattern); another 5 were included as\\nsub-groups in broader clusers. 50% (9/18) of clusters were rated over 3 on\\n5-point Likert scale for validity, significance, and being actionable. After\\nreviewing clusters, CDEs identified patterns that were more consistent with\\ndata (70% reduction in contradictions between patterns and participants'\\nrecords). Discussion: Hierarchical clustering of blood glucose and\\nmacronutrient consumption appears suitable for discovering behavioral-clinical\\nphenotypes in T2DM. Most clusters corresponded to gold standard and were rated\\npositively by CDEs for face validity. Cluster visualizations helped CDEs\\nidentify more robust patterns in nutrition and glycemic impact, creating new\\npossibilities for visual analytic solutions. Conclusion: Machine learning\\nmethods can use diabetes self-monitoring data to create personalized\\nbehavioral-clinical phenotypes, which may prove useful for delivering\\npersonalized medicine.\\n\",\n",

This has been rigorously proved for\\npermanents and for attractive graphical models.\\nHere we consider bipartite normal factor graphs and show that if the local\\nconstraints satisfy a certain analytic property, the Bethe approximation is a\\nlower bound to the partition function. We arrive at this result by viewing\\nfactor graphs through the lens of polynomials. In this process, we reformulate\\nthe Bethe approximation as a polynomial optimization problem.
